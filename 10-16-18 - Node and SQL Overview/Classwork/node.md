## Let's put some node work into practice!

1. To start we're going to make a simple node program for some back to basics.
    * Create a file with a function that takes two numbers as arguments. 
    * Create a main file that can be called with two arguments at run time.
    * If two numbers aren't provided, send a message to the console telling the user what went wrong.
    * If two numbers ARE provided, return a random number between those two.

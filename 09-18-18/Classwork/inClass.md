## Let's build a pizza ordering website together

We'll talk through what needs to be done for the site and set up requirements together but at a bare minimum we need to utilize the following:

* Local Storage
* At least one service
* Parent <-> Child component communication
* SASS for styling
* The following angular Directives
    * ngFor
    * ngModel
    * ngIf
    * ng-container
    * conditional classes
* Routing with at least one route param

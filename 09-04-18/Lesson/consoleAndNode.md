## The Console You Say?

### Basic Console Commands for Node and NPM
1. node -v
2. npm install {name} {flags}
3. node {file}

### Github and the Console
1. git init
2. git status (checks what you have to commit etc.)
3. git add (can use -A for all or add a relative path/paths)
4. git commit (can use the -m followed by a message in quotes or it will open a text editor to type a message into)
    * Commit messages should be ideally in present tense
    * Messages should be clear as to what is being committed
    * Remember to commit like things together ideally when a snippet of functionality is complete
5. git push (to push it to github online this might require you to set up an origin but your github repo should provide instructions for that if you have an existing repo)

## Let's implement some scss files in lieu of css files.
1. Take any styling out of the parent components / top level style file and move them to the relevant container.
2. Declare some variables and mixins in a shared file as needed.
3. Think about what all you might need to change in your file structure to get the styling to work the way you intended it to.

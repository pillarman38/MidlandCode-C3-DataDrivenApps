## Different Types of Database Languages: 
* NoSQL Databases:
    * With node, one of the biggest ones is MongoDB.
    * Allows for you to have a ton of flexibility in how you set up your Schema, OR how you change your schema depending on user/info given
    * Information can be stored as column-oriented, document-oriented, many others.
    * Has easy horizontal scalability which means you can grow faster in some cases.
* SQL Databases:
    * Tabular data
    * Everything is interconnected (or can be).
    * Doesn't allow for easy changing of Schema, but easy to follow when the schema is well built.
    * Simple to use data queries that follow mostly semantic key words.

## How To SQL
* Depending on what you want to do you start your `query` with one of several keywords:
    * Select 
    * Insert
    * Update
    * Create Table
    * Alter Table
    * Drop Table
* From there you can easily define what you're going to access by table, column name, or conditional options.
* Conditional Keywords:
    * NOT NULL
    * IN (x,y,z,...)
    * HAVING
    * LIKE (%hi%)
* Join Tables using type Join keyword and the type of Join you want:

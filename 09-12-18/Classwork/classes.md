## Let's refactor our todo component a little further:
1. Add a completed tag to the todos. This should be true or false but should start as false for any new todos.
2. Create a completed class that will change the text of the todo to green in the list component.
3. Have the new class attach to the todo html element if the todo is completed.
4. For added challenge let's add a checkbox to the list that when clicks changes the completed key to false/true and updates the array via the service.

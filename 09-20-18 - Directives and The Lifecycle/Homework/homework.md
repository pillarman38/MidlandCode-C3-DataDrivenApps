## Your homework assignment is pretty straightforward albeit a little complex. 
You need to take the work we've been doing on the pizza app and finalize it with styling, functionality, and everything. For added challenges you should do the following as well:
* Add at least one custom directive to the app.
* Think about separating out the two sub-components into their own with different routes and how you might redirect routes if certain criteria aren't met (this will have to be done in the component for now since we haven't covered Route AuthGuard)
* Add some fake addresses around town to the list of locations and use a google maps API to see distances to each one and order them by distance.

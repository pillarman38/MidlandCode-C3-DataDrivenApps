## Let's take our pizzaApp and animate it!
1. Add a transition between each of our routes. Let's have them fade in and out.
2. Now let's add an animation for when we add a pizza. We don't want the pizza addition form to just disappear, let's have it shrink or grow in to view depending on which direction it needs to go.

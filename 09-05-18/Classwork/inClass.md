## We'll be taking the existing app and adding a few components to it
1. Create a new component using the ng commands
2. Attach this component to the template for the base component
3. Have this component generate a random number and display it in the DOM
4. Create another component (without the ng commands)
5. Attach this component to the base component as well
6. Have an input field and a button in this template. Don't have either do anything yet though.

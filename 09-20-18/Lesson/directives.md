## What are Directives in Angular?
Well you've already been using them whether you realize it or not! Basically Directives are snippets of reusable code that you can attach to anything that matches a specific `selector`. Technically components are directives but your directive doesn't have to be just a component. 

### Key points of a Directive
* Surprise surprise it's a class! 
* You declare it with the @Directive decorator which can take several parameters to customize it. 
* Allows for simple code to be reused multiple times without having to repeat functionality
* Should not take the place of a component for more complex code. Also as it can't use a template you can only adjust what the element looks like / functions as without adding more code.


### How do we declare a Directive?
``` typescript
    @Directive({
        selector: '.aClass'
    })
    export class NewDirective{

        //Functionality of your directive
    }
```
It can also have a template if you would like as well.

### Selector Types
* The selector has to be a string but can be a string with multiple values separated by commas. 
* Can be an element name "my-directive" an example would be ng-container
* Can be a class ".class"
* An attribute "[attrName]" or attribute and value such as "[attrName=value]"
* You can use a :not(otherSelector) format for them


### Inputs and Outputs
You can bind inputs and outputs just like you would with a component. This allows you to utilize input values in some form of calculation for the element.

### Dealing with DOM events.
So let's say you want to have a directive that you want to make that on mouse hover you do something.

`@HostListener` is what yoo will use!

``` typescript
    @HostListener('mouseover') onMouseOver(){
        console.log('welcome to the element!');
    }
```

This is the basic pattern for any sort of event listener. If you have an `@Output` declared you can have this do something on mouse over or out.
Now what if you want to change the class inside of a directive? 

`@HostBinding` to the rescue!

``` typescript
    @HostBinding('attribute you want to bind to') private varName: typeOfNeededVar;
```

So let's say you have a variable in your Directive named bgColor. And you want the background color of the element with the directive to match the value of bgColor (which will change based off the input to the directive). This is as simple as:

``` typescript
    @HostBinding('style.background-color') private bgColor: string;
```

Simple as that!

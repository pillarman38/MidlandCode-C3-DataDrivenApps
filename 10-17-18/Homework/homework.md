## Pretty Basic Homework

* Install MAMP on your local machine and set up a user you can use for your SQL connection.
* Build a todos database with a todos table and a users table. Set them up with a schema you feel is appropriate. 
* Reach out if you run into any problems.
* Tomorrow we're going to be setting up the todos app we've been building in angular as a full fledged server with database connections and everything!

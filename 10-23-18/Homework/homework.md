## Homework
Homework is going to be super straight forward:
* Finish anything you didn't have time for in class today. Don't worry we'll review most of the day Tuesday
* If you have any questions, reach out on Slack
* Whether you have time to finish or not, think of at least three things that you might need to change for a prod server. (Ignore setting up a database on a non-local machine, etc.)

## Requirements
* Implement an authentication protocol of your choice, passport is a great starter library if you're not sure what to use.
* Build a login and signup strategy.
* Utilize the authentication via JWT authorization
* Protect any api routes behind authentication to make sure that an authenticated user is the one accessing the api route otherwise a forbidden status code should be sent.
